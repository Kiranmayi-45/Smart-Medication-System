## Motivation

Many peopleâ€”especially those with chronic illnesses or multiple prescriptionsâ€”struggle to keep track of when to take which medicine, miss doses, or misunderstand symptoms. The **Smart Medication System** aims to:

- Reduce medication errors and missed doses  
- Offer early alerts and reminders  
- Provide health insights (based on symptoms)  
- Support everyday wellness  

This tool can be used by patients, caregivers, or even integrated into health management platforms.

## Features

- **Medication Reminders** â€” Schedule medicine intake and get alerts  
- **Symptom-Based Prediction** â€” Enter symptoms; system suggests possible conditions  
- **Wellness Recommendations** â€” Tips or preventive advice based on health data  
- **User Authentication & Profile Management** â€” Secure user login, role-based access  
- **History & Logs** â€” View past medication alerts, symptom logs, predictions  

*(You can update or remove features depending on what your project actually supports.)*

## How It Works

1. **User Signs Up / Logs In**  
   The user creates an account, sets up a profile (age, health conditions, etc.).  

2. **Add Medications & Schedules**  
   The user enters their medicines, dosage times, and frequency.

3. **Reminder System**  
   The backend checks schedules and triggers alerts/notifications (email, SMS, push).

4. **Symptom Input & Prediction**  
   The user submits symptom data. A ML model on the server predicts possible diseases.

5. **Display Advice / Wellness Suggestions**  
   Based on predictions and user data, the system offers health tips or warnings.

6. **Logs & History**  
   All user activities (medication taken, missed, symptom entries, predictions) are stored, enabling analytics or review.
